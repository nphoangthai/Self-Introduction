# Introducing Myself 🤓
-----------------------------------------------
Hello there! I'm Thái (or James), a college student from Vietnam. My passion for data science comes from my love of the famous Sherlock Holmes 🕵🏼‍♂️ who use information to break the case, just like us data analysts use data to discover "interesting" insights 🤟. The two things I prioritize in my work is to use data ethically and responsibly.
